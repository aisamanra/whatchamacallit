Whatchamacallit
===============

Miscellaneous command-line utilities to do various small tasks. They're split
up into different libraries so they can be installed individually, but also
kept in a single repo because they're all tiny.

All these are licensed under the WTFPL.

RSAPair/
--------

A single RSAPair executable that produces a hex-encoded public/private key
pair on stdout. In Haskell; cabalized.

EscapedString/
-----------

Reads in stdin and produces an escaped string on stdout with surrounding
quotation marks, in particular by converting it to a JSON string and emitting
it. In Haskell; cabalized.

YAMLize/
--------

Two programs, one ToYAML which converts JSON on stdin to YAML on stdout, and
one FromYAML, which goes vice versa. May not round-trip correctly because of
the semantics of the GHC Yaml library. In Haskell; cabalized.

expseq/
-------

A rough analogue of seq for generating exponentially increasing numbers rather
than sequentially. In C; has Makefile.
