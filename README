Whatchamacallit
===============

Miscellaneous command-line utilities to do various small tasks. They're split
up into different libraries so they can be installed individually, but also
kept in a single repo because they're all tiny.

All these are licensed under the WTFPL unless noted otherwise.

quite useful. A mixed bag.
